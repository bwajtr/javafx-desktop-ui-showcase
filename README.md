# JavaFX Desktop UI Showcase

This is just a JavaFX sample application to show capabilities of JavaFX in JDK1.8.
To be precise, it's here just to showcase relation between fxml files, their controllers and how it would be possible to build a desktop UI application using JavaFX technology.

This is definitely a nice way how to build UI. Java desktop UI came a long way since AWT and Swing... awesome...

### What to expect

This is how the running sample should look like:

![Expected output image](/expectedOutput.png?raw=true "Expected output image")

### How to

You have to have JDK 8 installed and use JRE 8 to run the example. I'm using maven with executable jar feature, so just:

1. Run `mvn install`
2. Go to target directory
3. Run `java -jar javafx-showcase.jar` to see the output
