# JavaFX Desktop UI Showcase

This is just a JavaFX sample application to show capabilities of JavaFX in JDK1.8.
To be precise, it's here just to showcase relation between fxml files, their controllers and how to it would be possible to build a desktiop UI application using JavaFX technology.

Java desktop UI came a long way since AWT and Swing... nice...

### How to

You have to have JDK8 installed and use JRE 1.8 to run the example. I'm using maven with executable jar feature, so just:

1. Run `mvn install`
2. Go to target directory
3. Run `java -jar javafx-showcase.jar` to see the output
